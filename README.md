# HlpLib_Rust

## Plan:
- [x] 1. Create a function to translate hexdemical to ascii_hex
  - [x] 1.1 Create a dll and connect to C/C++ program  
  - [x] 1.2 Make it safety with additional functionality:
    - [x] 1.1.1 Give a possibility to return in format 0x00, 0x01, ...
    - [x] 1.1.2 Give a possibility to return in format 00 01 ...
    - [x] 1.1.3 Give a possibility to return in format 0001...
- [x] 2. Create a funcrion to translate ascii_hex to hexdemical
- [ ] 3. Make tests for this 2 functions

Simple library for making programming easier and secure.
